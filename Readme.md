# CARElorie
An educational game about calorie counting written in R (Shiny) <br>
Made for Engineering Systems Architecture course at Singapore University of Technology and Design

This repo was originally created to facilitate collaboration for the creation of this project, and with the project over it now serves as an archive of our work.

# Dependencies

- tidyverse
<br> <br>
This Shiny app was made to interface with a database on AWS, which will cease to exist by the time you read this. <br>
Nonetheless, the database has been downloaded as csv should you wish to recreate it. <br>
It should be noted that LeaderPlayer was a table that generated random player names from another Table with a list of words, but has since lost that functionality as a csv.

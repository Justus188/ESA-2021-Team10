"QuestionNo","QuestionStatement","QuestionAnswer","QuestionExplanation"
1,Are all fat bad for you?,,False! Artificial trans fats are what negatively affect your heart and health. Saturated fats do not cause health problems in moderate amounts.
2,Is having any coffee at all bad for you?,,"False! People have been arguing over whether coffee is good or bad for you for over a century. While drinking too much is not good, coffee is actually one of the biggest sources of antioxidants in the Western diet."
3,Energy drinks are worse than sodas: True or False,,"True! Many energy drinks have more sugar and calories than a cup of Pepsi of equal size. While they claim the energy boost comes from the vitamins in them, it's really just a sugar rush combined with caffeine and occasionally other substances."
4,Is eating egg yolks bad for everyone?,,"False! While diabetics might want to avoid egg yolks, eating eggs in moderation is actually good for most people. They are very nutritious and raise your good cholesterol, rather than your bad cholesterol."
5,Does eating fat really always make you fat?,,"False! While eating an excess of fat is bad, fat is not actually the health villain it has made out to be. We think of fat this way largely because the sugar industry funded studies to make fat look worse for you than sugar decades ago."
6,Are oranges a good way to get vitamin C?,,"True! Oranges are a solid source of vitamin C. Others include broccoli, papaya and red bell pepper."
7,Are all calories the same regardless of which foods they come from?,,"False! While a cheeseburger from McDonald's and an avocado might have the same amount of calories, they are still vastly different foods. Just because two foods have the same number of calories does not mean that they have the same nutrients or will affect your hormones and health in the same way."
8,"Are low-fat, high carb diets the healthiest?",,False! It is a popular myth that low-fat and high-carb diets cause weight loss and prevent disease. This has been explored in multiple scientific studies and been debunked by all of them.
9,Can spicy food really boost your metabolism?,,"True! Hot peppers have been shown to have a metabolism-boosting effect. However, if you can't take the heat, don't worry. Milder peppers may have some calorie-burning potential too!"
10,Is eating a high-protein diet bad for your bones in the long run?,,"False! One common myth is that eating a high-protein diet sucks the calcium out of your bones and can lead to osteoporosis. In the long term, however, high protein intake has been shown to lessen osteoporosis and fractures in old age."
11,"when foods are labelled ""natural"", does that actually mean anything?",,"True! The FDA does not regulate the use of the word, so it's more or less a marketing buzzword companies put on everything from fresh fruit to Cheetos. Always read the ingredients of what you eat and don't rely on labels."
12,Cooking food always destroys its nutrients : True or False,,"False! While many raw food advocates claim that cooking food makes it nutrition-less and cancer-causing, that is not accurate. Some foods release more of their nutrients when prepared in certain ways."
13,Potatoes are good for you: True or False?,,"True! While some consider potatoes to be empty carbs, that is wrong. They actually contain healthy phytochemicals, like flavanoids."
14,"Can you really eat as much as you want, as long as it's healthy?",,"False! While you are better off eating 600 calories of vegetables than 600 calories of cookies, overeating is never good for you. Moderation is always key."
15,Are the calories you eat at night more fattening than those eaten during the day?,,False! Calorie counts are the same for a food whether you eat it at 3 a.m. or p.m. This is an old myth that has to go!
16,Low-card diets are better for you than low-fat diets: True or False?,,"Low-carb diets are not for everyone, but they have been proven way more beneficial than low-fat diets in over a dozen studies. They are especially useful for people with certain conditions, like obesity and diabetes."
17,Is saturated fat a killer?,,"False! Nutrition is often more about balance than avoiding ""evil"" or ""bad"" foods. Recent studies have found that consuming reasonable amounts of saturated fat does not increase your stroke or heart attack risk and is actually good for you."
18,Does olive oil prevent heart disease?,,"True! The health benefits of olive oil come from the presence of polyphenols, antioxidants that reduce the risk of heart diseases and cancers."
19,Sugar soft drinks lead to diabetes?,,"True! A large 2004 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that women who drank one or more sugary drinks per day increased their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 83% compared to those who consumed less than one of these beverages per month. If you crave a drink with fizz, try soda water with some fresh lemon squeezed into it."
20,Does eating nuts make you fat?,,"False! As much as 75% of a nut is fat. But eating fat doesn't necessarily make you fat. The bigger factor leading to weight gain is portion-size. Luckily, nuts are loaded with healthy fats that keep you full. They're also a good source of protein and fibre."
21,Drinking fruit juice is as good for you as eating fruit,,"False! Calorie for calorie, whole fruit provides more nutritional benefits than drinking the pure juice of that fruit. That's because when you liquefy fruit, stripping away the peel and dumping the pulp, many ingredients like fibre, calcium, vitamin C, and other antioxidants are lost."
22,Yoghurt can ease digestive problems?,,"True! Yoghurt contains probiotics which can relieve several gastrointestinal problems, including constipation and diarrhoea."
23,Many foods are almost entirely water.,," True! Water is a large component of many foods, even meats."
24,Minerals can be changed into vitamins in the body.,,False! Minerals cannot be further broken down or converted into other substances by ordinary chemical means.
25, Fats yield more energy per gram than carbohydrates,,"True! One gram of protein yields about 4 kcal , 1 g of carbohydrate about 4 kcal, 1 g of fat about 9 kcal and 1 g of alcohol about 7 kcal."
26,Vitamins directly provide energy to the body.,,False! Vitamins provide no energy value in and of themselves. They merely aid in certain energy-yielding reactions.
27, The body generally requires greater daily amounts of vitamins than minerals.,,"False! Many minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, are required in much larger amounts than vitamins, for example, grams versus milligrams."
28,One gram of water can provide 1kcal of energy when metabolized by the body.,,"False! Water has no capacity to yield metabolizable energy in the body. Do not confuse this fact with the definition of the heat measurement unit, the kcal, which uses water."
29, The chemical term organic is related to the concept of organic gardening.,,False! Organic refers to compounds containing carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. The term has nothing to do with organic gardening.
30, Double blind studies generally employ a placebo.,,True! Use of a placebo help disguise which subjects are receiving the substance under study. This helps decrease bias in observations by the investigators.

34,"Because alcohol contains calories, it is considered a nutrient the same as carbohydrate, protein, and fat.",,"False! Although alcohol does contain calories (7kcal/g), it is not considered a nutrient because it has no required function."
35,"All dietary fats are equally harmful, so one should work toward complete elimination of fat from the diet.",,"False! Although excess fat in the diet can lead to weight gain and may result in chronic disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease), some fat is essential in the diet. Essential fatty acids, for example, help regulate blood pressure and play a role in the synthesis and repair of vital cell parts."
36,Much of what we know about nutrition was discovered in the last century.,,True! Research in the 20th century has contributed most of our current knowledge about nutrition. Much of this research took place in the United States.
37,We have little to no control over our health with respect to disease.,,"False! Though genetic predisposition has some influence, eating a well-balanced diet, in combination with a healthy lifestyle, can lead to a healthier life."
38,Fiber is not important,,"False! High-fiber foods help keep your digestive system healthy. Try to get 25 to 38 grams of fiber a day. Also, remember to drink plenty of water to prevent constipation"
39,Low-fat foods are always better,,"False! Just because a food is low-fat or fat-free does not mean it's always a better nutritional choice. For instance, fat-free cookies have the same amount of sugar and calories, or often even more, than regular cookies. Read labels"
40,Fats do not provide energy to our body,,False! Fats and carbohydrates provide energy to our body and are called energy giving food or nutrients.
41,"Carbs, proteins, and fat all have about the same amount of calories, True or False",,"False! Carbohydrate and protein each weigh in at 4 calories per gram, while fat has 9 calories per gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. Ounce for ounce, foods that contain mostly fat are more than twice as calorie-dense as carbs or protein."
42,"You don't need to eat fruits, vegetables or whole grain foods to get your daily requirements for fiber",,"To meet the 20 to 35 gram daily target for fiber, eat at least five serving of fruits and vegetables a day, plus three servings of whole grain foods like whole wheat breads and cereals. Dietary fiber plays a variety of roles in maintaining good health."
43,Eating fat makes you fat,,"False! Eating sugar makes you fat! Fat is an essential part of your diet and contains essential vitamins and nutrients our body's require to maintain health.  Furthermore, certain good fats actually turn off the fat storing genes and turn on the fat burning ones"
44,Losing weight on the scales is a good sign of fat loss,,False! Weight loss could also be due to a loss of muscle  mass as well!
45,Skipping breakdast is a good way to trim calories,,"False! Skipping breakfast usually leads to intense hunger, which in turn leads to overeating. Studies have shown that most overweight people skip the morning meal to save calories, but ultimately end up eating more than people who regularly break the fast."
46,"""Empty calories"" refers to foods that are free or have virtually no calories, True or False",,"False! Empty calorie foods are those that offer little nutritional value, but lots of calories. Most empty-calorie foods have few vitamins minerals, or fiber, but are high in calories, fat, and/or sugar."
47,"Certain foods, like grapefruit, celery, or cabbage soup, can burn fat and make you lose weight.",,"False! No foods can burn fat. Some foods with caffeine may speed up your metabolism (the way your body uses energy, or calories) for a short time, but they do not cause weight loss. The best way to lose weight is to cut back on the number of calories you eat and be more physically active."
48,Most packaged foods have a Nutrition Facts label.,,"True! For a healthier you, use this Nutrition Facts label to make smart food choices. Keep saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugar low. Get enough potassium, fiber, vitamins A and C, calcium, and iron. Check servings and calories."
49,Lowfat or fat-free means no calories.,,False! A lowfat or fat-free food is often lower in calories than the same size portion of the full-fat product. But many processed lowfat or fat-free foods have just as many calories as the full-fat version of the same food or even more calories
50,Eating fruits and vegetables is part of a healthy eating plan.,,"True! A healthy eating plan is one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products; includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts; and is low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars."
51,Eating red meat is bad for your health.,,"False! Eating lean meat in small amounts can be part of a healthy diet. Red meat, pork, chicken, and fish contain some cholesterol and saturated fat (the least healthy kind of fat). They also contain healthy nutrients like protein, iron, and zinc. Choose cuts of meat that are lower in fat and trim all visible fat"
52,"Low-fat and fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese are just as nutritious as whole milk dairy products.",,"True! Lowfat and fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese are just as nutritious as whole milk dairy products, but they are lower in fat and calories. Dairy products have many nutrients your body needs. They offer protein to build muscles and help organs work properly, and calcium to strengthen bones. Most milk and some yogurts are fortified with vitamin D to help your body use calcium."
53,Canned soups and stews that are fat-free or lowfat and lowsodium are good food choices when you are in a hurry.,,"True! Pack your kitchen with time-saving nutrients. Look for fat-free or lowfat and low-sodium items like canned or frozen fruits, vegetables, beans, or meat; canned soups or stews; whole-grain bread or crackers; enriched or whole grain pasta; enriched or brown rice; cheese; and yogurt."
54,It is recommended that 10-35% of your calorie intake should come from protein,,"True! It is recommended that 10-35% of your calorie intake come from protein, depending on how active your lifestyle is"
55,Athletes need more protein than couch potatoes,,True! How active you are affects how much protein your body needs. Athletes may need slightly more protein than non-athletes to repair and rebuild muscles after all the workout
56,A high-protein diet can help you lose weight,,True! Some studies show that replacing protein for carbs may help you lose weight. High-protein foods move more slowly through your digestive system. That helps you feel full longer after you eat. And your body burns more calories digesting protein than digesting carbs.
57,Too much protein can be unhealthy ,,"True! Usually, it's not a big deal to eat more protein than you need. But eating more protein means more calories, which can lead to weight gain. And if the protein is from meat or other animal sources, it might be high in saturated fat, which can lead to high cholesterol and heart disease. Too much protein can also cause problems if you have medical conditions, such as kidney disease or diabetes."
58,Our bodies are good at storing protein to use later,,False! Our bodies don't store proteins the way they store carbs and fats. That's why you need a steady supply of protein every day.
59,You can help build muscle by eating protein right after a workout,,True! Protein can help repair muscles after working out. Many studies show that having high-protein foods or drinks soon after exercise helps build and restore muscle. But protein is only part of the story. The other key nutrient to strengthen muscles is carbohydrates.
